# Linear-Regression

Imagine you have a dataset like the one below for a regression problem. You want to create a linear model for this dataset and predict the column 'y' based on the input 'X'. Calculate the equations manually for three iterations and find the final linear equation. To calculate prediction errors, use both the quadratic error and absolute error based on the actual values. Finally, plot both obtained lines on the data.

X: 1.2, 2.5, 3.6
y: 8.5, 9.2, 10.1
